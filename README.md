# Playlist Quest

## Description

Playlist Quest gamifies the process of finding new music. Select or skip songs as they pop up on your screen. Your recommended songs and songs that you selected will be used to continously recommend new songs until you're done. At the end, these songs can be exported as a playlist to your spotify account.
